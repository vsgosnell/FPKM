# Overview

The `FPKM` package provides utilities for processing and visualizing RNA-seq data using **FPKM** (**F**ragments **P**er **K**ilobase of transcript per **M**illion mapped reads) normalization.

**FPKM** is a commonly used method to normalize RNA-seq data, enabling the comparison of $\underline{gene\space expression}$ levels between samples. It adjusts for both the *length* of the gene and the *total number of reads* in the sample, offering a way to account for **variations** in sequencing depth and gene length. This allows for more accurate comparison of expression levels across genes and samples in RNA-seq experiments.

---

# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `FPKM` package to analyze RNA-seq data. We will cover several common tasks, such as reading in RNA-seq data, filtering low-expression genes, normalizing for gene length and sequencing depth, and generating key visualizations such as heatmaps, boxplots, and Principle Component Analysis (PCA).

---

## Installation

First, make sure you have the `FPKM` package installed. You can install it from GitHub with the following command:

```{r installation, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("vsgosnell/FPKM")
```

---

# Loading the Package
## Once installed, load the package and required libraries for this tutorial:


```{r}
library(FPKM)
library(ggplot2)
```

---

# Loading Data
The first step in RNA-seq analysis is to load your data. We will load the RNA-seq data from the `vehicle_drug_feature_counts.txt` file. The file contains read counts for multiple samples, including vehicle (*control*) and drug treatment conditions. 

The `read_rna_seq_data()` function reads in the count matrix and handles any required preprocessing (e.g., removing header metadata).

Download: [vehicle_drug_feature_counts.txt](https://github.com/vsgosnell/FPKM/blob/main/data/vehicle_drug_feature_counts.txt)


```{r read RNAseq data, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
# Manually specify the absolute path
vehicle_drug_data_path <- "/Users/veronicagosnell/Desktop/R/FPKM/inst/extdata/vehicle_drug_feature_counts.txt"

# Then use the path to load data
vehicle_drug_data <- read_rna_seq_data(vehicle_drug_data_path)

colnames(vehicle_drug_data)[colnames(vehicle_drug_data) == "length"] <- "Length"

# Manually set the sample columns 
sample_columns <- c("vehicle_rep1.bam", "vehicle_rep2.bam", "drug_rep1.bam", "drug_rep2.bam")
```

### View the first few rows to confirm it loaded correctly

```{r head RNAseq data, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
head(vehicle_drug_data)
```


### This dataset contains the following columns:

- **GeneID**: The gene identifier

- **Chr**: The chromosome

- **Start**: The start position of the gene

- **End**: The end position of the gene

- **Strand**: The positive or negative strand of the gene

- **Length**: The length of the gene

- **vehicle_rep1, vehicle_rep2, drug_rep1, drug_rep2**: 
    - The read counts for different replicates of the vehicle and drug treatments

---

---

# Calculating FPKM Values

Once the data is loaded, you can compute **FPKM values**. This method is used to normalize gene expression data in RNA-seq experiments by accounting for *sequencing depth* and *gene length*. 

The `calculate_fpkm()` function calculates the **FPKM values** from *read counts* and *gene lengths*.


```{r calculate FPKM, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
sample_columns <- grep("\\.bam$", colnames(vehicle_drug_data), value = TRUE)

fpkm_values <- calculate_fpkm(vehicle_drug_data, sample_columns)
```
### Results:

- This function returns a data frame containing the **FPKM values** for each gene across all samples. 

- **FPKM** normalizes expression levels by both gene length (longer genes tend to have more reads) and library size (total read count per sample). This makes expression levels more **comparable** across genes and samples.

---

---

# Filtering Low Expression Genes

To improve the accuracy of downstream analysis, we can filter out genes with **low expression** levels. 

The `filter_low_expression()` function allows us to filter genes based on a threshold **FPKM** value.

```{r filter low expression, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
# Save gene IDs separately from vehicle_drug_data
geneid_vector <- vehicle_drug_data$geneid

# Select only numeric sample columns
sample_columns <- fpkm_values[, sapply(fpkm_values, is.numeric)]

# Set gene IDs as row names BEFORE filtering
rownames(sample_columns) <- make.unique(as.character(geneid_vector))

# Filter out low-expression genes (e.g., average FPKM < 1)
filtered_data <- filter_low_expression(sample_columns, threshold = 1)
```

### Why filter?

- Genes with consistently **low expression** can introduce *noise*.

- Filtering improves downstream analyses like clustering, PCA, and differential expression.

# Visualizing Gene Expression

## Heatmap of Gene Expression

We can create a heatmap to visualize the **gene expression patterns** of the most variable genes across the samples using the `plot_expression_heatmap()` function.


#### **What this does:**

1. **Compute variance** for each gene (row) across your samples

2. **Order** genes by descending variance and pick the top `N`

3. **Subset** your *filtered* FPKM matrix to those genes

4. **Center & scale** each row so differences are on the same scale

5. **Plot** with `pheatmap`, showing just those top `N` genes

$\underline{You\space can\space adjust:}$  
  
  - `N` (e.g. 25, 50, 200)  

  - `show_rownames = TRUE` if you want to see **gene IDs**  

  - `scale = "row"` inside `pheatmap()` instead of *manually* scaling 


```{r heatmap-top-variables, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}
# Plot heatmap of top 100 most variable genes
plot_expression_heatmap(filtered_data, top_n = 100)
```

### Results:

    - **Rows** = genes

    - **Columns** = samples

    - **Color** changes indicate relative *expression differences*

- $\underline{Clustering}$ helps identify patterns of co-expression and sample similarity


---

---

## Boxplot of FPKM Distribution

A boxplot can be helpful to visualize the distribution of **gene expression** across samples.


```{r FPKM Distribution Boxplot, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Check the structure of filtered_data
str(filtered_data)

plot_fpkm_boxplot(filtered_data)
```

### Results:

- Boxplots show **median**, **quartiles**, and **outliers** of log-transformed `FPKM` values

  - Helps assess sample distribution and variability

- RNA-seq data commonly contains lots of genes with 0 or *near-zero* expression

  - These low values create a long lower tail, and the few highly expressed genes pull the median and upper quartile upward

  - So when you plot individual points (like geom_jitter()), they tend to bunch up at the **upper end** of the visible range (i.e., the *top* whisker)
  
  - This can be adjusted according to your needs

---

---


## Distribution of FPKM Values

To assess the **overall distribution** of expression levels, we can plot the distribution of `FPKM` values.

```{r FPKM Distribution Bar Graph, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Convert to data frame if it's still a matrix
filtered_data <- as.data.frame(filtered_data)

# Add a column for average FPKM across all samples
filtered_data$FPKM <- rowMeans(filtered_data[, sapply(filtered_data, is.numeric)])

# Then plot distribution of FPKM values
plot_fpkm_distribution(filtered_data$FPKM)
```

### Results:

- Most genes have *low* expression (often log-normal distribution)

- Useful for choosing **filtering thresholds** and detecting global shifts

---

---

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

To explore the overall variation in the data, we can perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the `FPKM` values. 

**PCA** is used to reduce *dimensionality* and visualize major **patterns** in gene expression data that capture the most important variation across samples. This enables visualization of groupings, patterns, and outliers in a simple 2D plot.


## Quick PCA Visualization

The `FPKM` package provides a convenient wrapper function, `plot_pca_fpkm()`, that performs **log-transformation**, **PCA**, and **plotting** in one step. 

It displays the *first two* principal components, which together explain most of the variance in the data. 

Below, shows both this quick-use function and a step-by-step breakdown of how **PCA** is performed on the `FPKM` dataset.


```{r PCA simple, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Use the wrapper function for a quick PCA plot
plot_pca_fpkm(filtered_data)
```

### Results:

- Can reveal batch effects, sample outliers, or treatment separation

- Samples that cluster together have **similar expression profiles**

  - If treated and untreated samples cluster separately along PC1 or PC2:

    - This suggests that treatment strongly *influences* gene expression

- If samples from the same group cluster tightly:

  - Indicates *reproducibility* within conditions

- Outliers or overlapping clusters might indicate **batch effects** or **subtle expression changes**

# PCA: Step-by-Step Breakdown

While the `plot_pca_fpkm()` function provides a fast and convenient way to visualize **PCA** results, this section walks through the process step-by-step. This approach is useful for users who want to customize the analysis or better understand how **PCA** is computed and interpreted from their `FPKM` data.

```{r PCA breakdown colored, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Log-transform filtered data
log_fpkm <- log2(filtered_data + 1)

# Remove non-sample columns
log_fpkm_clean <- log_fpkm[, grepl("vehicle|drug", colnames(log_fpkm), ignore.case = TRUE)]

# Transpose for PCA (samples as rows, genes as columns)
pca_input <- t(log_fpkm_clean)

# Run PCA
pca_result <- prcomp(pca_input, scale. = TRUE)

# Calculate percentage of variance explained by PC1 and PC2
pve <- round(100 * summary(pca_result)$importance[2, 1:2], 1)

# Create PCA data frame for plotting
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_result$x)
pca_df$Sample <- rownames(pca_df)

# Assign conditions based on sample names
pca_df$Condition <- ifelse(grepl("vehicle", pca_df$Sample, ignore.case = TRUE), "Vehicle",
                    ifelse(grepl("drug", pca_df$Sample, ignore.case = TRUE), "Drug", "Unknown"))

# Plot PCA with color by condition
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Condition, label = Sample)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_text(vjust = 1.5, size = 4) +
  labs(title = "PCA of log2(FPKM + 1) Expression",
       x = paste0("PC1 (", pve[1], "%)"),
       y = paste0("PC2 (", pve[2], "%)")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Vehicle" = "#3498DB", "Drug" = "#E74C3C")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```

### Results:

    - Implements the full PCA pipeline inline
    - Explains and displays PC1/PC2 variance

- PC1 and PC2 capture the **most significant sources of variation** in the dataset

- Samples clustering together on the PCA plot are more similar in expression profiles

- This plot helps identify batch effects, outliers, or biological groupings

### Customizing PCA plot:

The plot can be modified in several ways depending on your needs:

- Add **color** or **shape** by *condition* (i.e., treatment vs control) to visually distinguish biological groups

- Change **scale. argument** to normalize variance across genes

- Use **other Principle Components** (i.e., PC3, PC4, etc.) to analyze more subtle variation

- Add **confidence ellipses** to show group dispersion using stat_ellipse()

# Correlation Between Samples

We can also check the correlation between samples using the `plot_sample_correlation()` function.

```{r Correlation Heatmap, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Drop FPKM column if present
filtered_data_no_fpkm <- filtered_data[, !colnames(filtered_data) %in% "FPKM"]

# Plot correlation between samples
plot_sample_correlation(as.matrix(filtered_data_no_fpkm))
```

### Results:

- Highly correlated samples should cluster *together*

- Useful **quality control** step to confirm experimental replicates behave similarly
